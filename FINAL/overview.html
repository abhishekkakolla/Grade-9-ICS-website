				<h2 class = "sect_title">What is a CPU?</h2>
				<p>
					The CPU stands for "Central Processing Unit." It is often referred to as the "brain of the computer" because it facilitates the basic tasks of the computer. 
					As its name suggests, the CPU is a processing device that is solely responsible for executing commands in programs.
				</p>
				
				<div class = "subsect">
					<h3 class = "subsect_title">Why is the CPU important?</h3>
					<p>
						Since the CPU carries the full burden of executing instructions, you want a fast CPU to maximize your computer speed. 
						The CPU used have a much more significant influence on a computer's performance, 
						but it still plays a major role today. A powerful CPU won't be a bottleneck in your computer.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class = "subsect">
					<h3 class = "subsect_title">What is the CPU made of?</h3>
					<p>
						In the old days, the CPU contained only a single processing core.
						<span class = "pop_up_bt">(what is a processing core?)</span>
						<span class = "pop_up_text">
								<br/><br/>
								It is often easy to confuse the terms "processor" and "processing core." The terms "CPU" and "processor" can be used interchangeably, 
								but a processing core is not exactly the same as a CPU. In general, a processing core can be thought of as a single unit that carries out one instruction at a time.
								The CPU is essentially a groups of processing cores collaborating. Since each processing core can handle a single task, 
								having multiple processing cores will allow the CPU to multi-task. Thanks to technology, 
								current processing cores use "multi-threading" to create virtual cores, thus enabling them to multi-task.
								However, these virtual cores are not as powerful as a physical core.
						</span>
						<br/><br/>
						Modern CPUs contain multiple processors, called cores, which work together to process instructions. 
						Currently, there are CPUs with 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and even 12 or 16 cores.
