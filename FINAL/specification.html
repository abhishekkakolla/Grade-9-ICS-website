			<h1 class = "header">History of the CPU</h1>
			<img alt = "Logic Gate" src = "images/logic-gate.png" class = "image image-left"><p class = "paragraph" style = "margin-top: 80px;">The history 
			of CPUs dates all the way back to 1903.
			In <b>1903</b>, Nikola Tesla 
			patented his <b>electrical logic circuit</b>, called a "gate", or a "switch." 
			It used an on-off switch to perform logical 
			operations, hence the name switch.
			This device was the <i>beginning</i> of the CPU	. 
			</p>
			
			<img alt = "Transistor" src = "images/transistor.jpg" class = "image image-right">
			<p class = "paragraph" style = "margin-top: 100px;">In <b>1947</b>, John Bardeen,
			Walter Brattain, and William Shockley created the first <b>transistor</b>. A
			transistor amplifies or switches electronic signals or power. Like Tesla's
			logic "switches," it can be used for binary 0 and 1 (on-off) switches. However, 
			transistors can be grouped together to form more complex logic gates. Transistors
			form the basis of all <i>modern computers</i>, thus their inception is a major breakthrough for computing technology.
			</p>
			
			<img alt = "Integrated Circuit" src = "images/integrated-circuit.jpg" class = "image image-left">
			<p class = "paragraph" style = "margin-top: 100px;">	About a decade later, in <b>1958</b>, Robert Noyce invented
			the <b>integrated circuit</b>. An integrated circuit is an important 
			component of the computer. It is a small chip consisting of a 
			series of <i>resistors and transistors</i>. 	Not long after Noyce invented the integrated circuit, IBM developed 
			the first automatic mass-production facility for transistors in 1960, bringing the product into the market.
			</p>
			
			<img alt = "Intel 4004" src = "images/4004.jpg" class = "image image-right">
			<p class = "paragraph" style = "margin-top: 100px;">The year <b>1971</b> had marked a breakthrough in computing technology: Intel 
			created the first ever <b>microprocessor</b>. This microprocessor, the <u>Intel 
			4004</u>, had 2300 transistors, 640 bytes of memory, could perform 60,000 
			operations per second (60 kHz), and had cost $200. To compare, even the cheapest processors today have clock speeds of several GHz and 
			are ~ 10^5 times faster than the Intel 4004. Yet, they cost about $100, which is far less than the $200 of the 4004.
