					<li><span class = "nested_ul_hd">CPU Overview</span>
						<ul>
							<li><p>The CPU facilitates all tasks of computer; is solely responsible for executing commands</p></li>
							<li><p>Early CPUs only have one processor; todays CPUs are actually a collection of individual processors working together</p></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li><span class = "nested_ul_hd">CPU History</span>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Nicola Tesla patented a logic circuit in 1903; these logic "gates" were the basis of the CPU</p></li>
							<li><p>The first transistor was invented in 1947; operates similarly to Tesla's logic gates</p></li>
							<li><p>Transistors are the building blocks of the CPU; enables it to perform logical operations</p></li>
							<li><p>Intel built the first ever microprocessor (CPU) in 1970</p></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li><span class = "nested_ul_hd">Today's CPU</span>
						<ul>
							<li><p>AMD and Intel are two major CPU producers</p></li>
							<li><p>They produce some of the most popular models today</p></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li><span class = "nested_ul_hd">The CPU's Future</span>
						<ul>
							<li><p>CPU processing speed and capability has grown exponentially in past decades</p></li>
							<li><p>But they will eventually reach their physical limits; experts predict this will happen in the 2020s</p></li>
							<li><p>Improvements in software, such as the cloud and wireless communication may be the necessary to improve efficiency of computers</p></li>
							<li><p>Recently, quantum computing has become a hot topic; quantum computers exploit quantum mechanics to operate much faster than classical computers</p></li>
							<li><p>Quantum computers may be the future of computing</p></li>
